# Oracle Graph

Graphs enable you to find connections and explore relationships in your data. Oracle Graph is an AI-ready, integrated feature of Oracle's converged database that eliminates the need for a separate graph database and data movement. Analysts and developers can address various use cases, including financial fraud detection and manufacturing traceability, while gaining enterprise-grade security, ease of data ingestion, and strong support for operational workloads.
